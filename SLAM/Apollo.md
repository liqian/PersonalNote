# OpenHDMap
- https://github.com/daohu527/OpenHDMap
- This is an open source HD map project for autonomous driving. 
The precision map production process is divided into four parts: 
    map collection, 
    map production, 
    map labeling, 
    and map saving. 
This project mainly uses lidar as a collection sensor to provide the map making process.
